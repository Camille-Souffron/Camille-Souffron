- ðŸ‘‹ Hi friends, I'm an economist specialising in **Macroecon, Non-linear Dynamics, Ecological Econ, Expectations Theory and Epistemology**, in close collaboration with Prof. GaÃ«l Giraud sj. 
- ðŸŒ± I teach economics at **ENS Ulm** (Paris, where I also study), the EPOG Master's programme, ESSEC and Cergy University, after being a research fellow at the Environmental Justice Program at Georgetown University (USA).
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m looking to have **interdisciplinary** collaborations on those topics and more broadly, on the epistemology of modelling and on economics for the Anthropocene, so do not hesitate to reach me (biologists, philosophers, physicists...) :
