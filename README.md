- ðŸ‘‹ Hi friends, I'm an economist specialising in **Macroeconomics/Macro-econometrics, Non-linear & Endogenous Dynamics, Ecological Econ, and Epistemology**. 
- ðŸŒ± I teach economics at **ENS Ulm** (Paris, where I also study alongside Paris School of Economics), the EPOG Master's programme, ESSEC and Cergy University, after being a research fellow at the Environmental Justice Program at Georgetown University (USA).
- ðŸ“« Iâ€™m looking to have **interdisciplinary** collaborations on those topics and more broadly, on the epistemology of modelling and on economics for our current polycrisis, so do not hesitate to reach me (biologists, philosophers, physicists...) :
